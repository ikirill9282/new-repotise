      'paragraph-9' => '<h2><strong>9. Advertising Policy</strong></h2><h3><strong>9.1. Advertising on the Marketplace</strong></h3><p>The Marketplace explicitly reserves the right, exercisable in its sole and absolute discretion, to display advertisements, promotional content, sponsored listings, and other forms of commercial solicitations throughout various sections, pages, and functionalities of the platform, including, but not limited to, prominent placement within news and articles sections, blog entries, community forums, product listings, seller profiles, and user dashboards. Such advertisements may include, but are not limited to, contextual advertisements served through third-party advertising networks and programmatic advertising platforms, such as Google AdSense, as well as direct advertising placements, sponsored content integrations, affiliate marketing links, and promotional partnerships arranged and managed directly by the Marketplace. The types, formats, placement, frequency, and overall presentation of advertisements on the Marketplace are subject to change, modification, or removal at any time, without prior notice or explanation, in the Marketplace\'s sole and exclusive discretion. Advertisers, content creators participating in revenue-sharing programs, and all other parties providing advertising content for display on the Marketplace must, at all times, fully and scrupulously adhere to all applicable advertising guidelines, content policies, community standards, legal requirements, and ethical principles, as promulgated and enforced by the Marketplace from time to time.</p><h3><strong>9.2. Revenue Sharing with Content Authors (Advertising Revenue)</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;The Marketplace, at its sole discretion and as a purely voluntary and gratuitous incentive program, may offer a revenue-sharing program to selectively compensate content authors who contribute original, high-quality, and demonstrably valuable news articles, blog posts, editorial content, and other forms of informational or educational materials to the platform, as determined by the Marketplace in its sole and exclusive editorial judgment. This discretionary program, if and when offered, may allow eligible authors, as determined by the Marketplace, to potentially earn a purely discretionary and non-guaranteed portion of the net advertising revenue, if any, actually and demonstrably generated by the Marketplace directly and exclusively from advertisements specifically and directly displayed within, directly alongside, or immediately adjacent to their original articles, blog posts, or other qualifying content contributions, specifically limited to advertisements served through Google AdSense or similar third-party advertising networks programmatically integrated into the Marketplace platform.<br>&nbsp;The percentage of advertising revenue, if any, shared with eligible content authors, if and when such revenue sharing is offered by the Marketplace, is determined arbitrarily and unilaterally by the Marketplace, in its sole and exclusive discretion, and may be subject to change, modification, or complete termination at any time, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without any obligation, liability, or recourse of any kind or nature whatsoever on the part of the Marketplace. For illustrative and informational purposes only, and without creating any contractual obligation, legal commitment, or user entitlement, the Marketplace may, from time to time, elect, in its sole and unreviewable discretion, to utilize a tiered commission structure, which, if implemented, may hypothetically resemble the following non-binding, purely discretionary, and unilaterally modifiable commission levels:</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 1 Authors:</strong> May, at the Marketplace\'s sole discretion, hypothetically receive up to 40% of the advertising revenue, if any, demonstrably and directly generated from advertisements displayed in direct and immediate proximity to their qualifying articles, blog posts, or other content contributions, as definitively determined and meticulously calculated by the Marketplace through its internal, proprietary, and non-transparent revenue attribution methodologies and accounting practices.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 2 Authors:</strong> May, at the Marketplace\'s sole discretion, hypothetically receive up to 30% of the advertising revenue, if any, demonstrably and directly generated from advertisements displayed in direct and immediate proximity to their qualifying articles, blog posts, or other content contributions, as definitively determined and meticulously calculated by the Marketplace through its internal, proprietary, and non-transparent revenue attribution methodologies and accounting practices.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 3 Authors: </strong>May, at the Marketplace\'s sole discretion, hypothetically receive up to 20% of the advertising revenue, if any, demonstrably and directly generated from advertisements displayed in direct and immediate proximity to their qualifying articles, blog posts, or other content contributions, as definitively determined and meticulously calculated by the Marketplace through its internal, proprietary, and non-transparent revenue attribution methodologies and accounting practices.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 4 Authors: </strong>May, at the Marketplace\'s sole discretion, hypothetically receive up to 10% of the advertising revenue, if any, demonstrably and directly generated from advertisements displayed in direct and immediate proximity to their qualifying articles, blog posts, or other content contributions, as definitively determined and meticulously calculated by the Marketplace through its internal, proprietary, and non-transparent revenue attribution methodologies and accounting practices.<br>&nbsp;These hypothetical, non-binding, and purely illustrative commission levels, if and when offered, may be arbitrarily based, in whole or in part, on the author\'s overall contribution, perceived content quality, demonstrable user engagement metrics, subjective editorial assessments, or any other criteria, factors, or considerations unilaterally determined and arbitrarily modified by the Marketplace from time to time, in its sole and unreviewable discretion, without any obligation to provide prior notice, justification, or transparency to content authors or other users. The Marketplace explicitly reserves the absolute, unfettered, and non-reviewable right to comprehensively modify, unilaterally alter, arbitrarily adjust, substantially curtail, or completely terminate the author level criteria, revenue sharing percentages, program eligibility requirements, payout schedules, or any and all other aspects of this purely discretionary and gratuitous advertising revenue sharing program at any time, with or without prior notice, explanation, or justification, and without incurring any liability or obligation of any kind or nature whatsoever to content authors, users, or any other party.<br>&nbsp;Revenue sharing payouts, if and when actually and voluntarily offered by the Marketplace, will be calculated and credited to eligible author accounts on a purely discretionary and non-guaranteed monthly basis, typically within an estimated and non-binding timeframe of 10–15 business days after the end of each calendar month, strictly subject to successful and error-free processing by third-party payment processors, such as Stripe, and further contingent upon numerous factors that are wholly outside the Marketplace\'s control, including, but not limited to, actual advertising revenue generation, advertiser payment defaults, fluctuations in advertising demand, changes in advertising network policies, and technical malfunctions or errors in revenue tracking and attribution systems. Authors must accrue and maintain a minimum verified and non-disputed balance of fifty United States dollars ($50.00 USD) in demonstrably attributable advertising revenue share earnings, as definitively determined and meticulously calculated by the Marketplace through its internal, proprietary, and non-transparent revenue attribution methodologies and accounting practices, before a withdrawal request can be even considered for potential discretionary processing by the Marketplace, consistent with the minimum withdrawal balance requirements applicable to sellers of digital products, as set forth in the Payment Policy and Seller Agreement. Any and all payouts, if and when actually and voluntarily offered and processed by the Marketplace, are explicitly and unconditionally subject to deduction of any and all applicable third-party payment processor transaction fees, currency conversion fees, withdrawal fees, and any other fees, charges, assessments, or deductions that may be imposed, assessed, or levied by third-party payment processors, intermediary financial institutions, or governmental authorities, as well as the comprehensive and controlling terms, conditions, limitations, restrictions, and disclaimers meticulously set forth in the Payment Policy, Seller Agreement, and these Terms and Conditions.<br>&nbsp;The Marketplace explicitly reserves the absolute, unfettered, discretionary, and non-reviewable right to comprehensively modify, unilaterally alter, arbitrarily adjust, substantially curtail, completely suspend, or permanently terminate this advertising revenue-sharing program, in whole or in part, at any time, for any reason, or for no reason whatsoever, with or without prior notice, explanation, or justification, and without incurring any liability or obligation of any kind or nature whatsoever to content authors, users, or any other party. The Marketplace provides no representations, warranties, covenants, or guarantees, either express or implied, statutory, contractual, or otherwise, that content authors will actually receive any specific level of advertising revenue, or any advertising revenue whatsoever, from their content contributions, as advertising revenue generation is inherently contingent upon numerous volatile, unpredictable, and uncontrollable factors that are wholly outside the Marketplace\'s control, including, but not limited to, overall website traffic, user engagement metrics, advertisement placement optimization, click-through rates, conversion rates, advertiser demand, seasonal fluctuations in advertising spending, macroeconomic conditions, changes in advertising network algorithms, and numerous other market-driven and technological variables that are subject to constant change and unpredictable volatility.</p><h3><strong>9.3.

Your interactions, transactions, and engagements with any advertisers or sponsors whose advertising content is displayed on the marketplace are solely and exclusively between you and the applicable advertiser or sponsor, and you explicitly acknowledge and agree that you assume any and all risks associated with such interactions, transactions, and engagements.</p><h3><strong>9.4.

The Marketplace assumes no responsibility or liability for the tax obligations of non-U.S. resident sellers.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>No Tax Advice:</strong> The Marketplace does not provide tax advice. The automatic generation and filing of Form 1099-NEC for eligible U.S. resident sellers is solely a service to facilitate compliance with U.S. tax law.

These automated checks, if and when implemented, may, or may not, focus on keywords, textual patterns, visual elements, branding indicia, pricing data, and other discernible characteristics of the listing that may, in the Marketplace’s sole judgment, suggest potential violations, deficiencies, or areas of concern.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Selective Manual Quality Reviews by Marketplace Personnel:</strong> Designated Marketplace personnel, acting under the Marketplace’s sole and exclusive direction and control, may, or may not, conduct discretionary, targeted, and non-systematic manual reviews of a limited and non-representative sample of Seller product listings, selected at the Marketplace’s sole option and discretion, to subjectively assess, evaluate, and opine upon various qualitative aspects of the listings, including, without limitation, perceived product quality, demonstrable accuracy of product descriptions, overall user experience considerations, and subjective impressions of general compliance with Marketplace standards, aspirational guidelines, and best practices, including the non-binding hypothetical Quality Standards illustratively<strong> </strong>outlined in Section 3.1 of this Seller Agreement. Seller explicitly acknowledges and agrees that any such manual quality reviews are inherently subjective, non-comprehensive, and undertaken solely for the Marketplace’s internal quality control and risk management purposes, and shall not be construed to create any warranties, representations, or guarantees to Seller or any third party regarding the actual quality, legality, or marketability of Seller’s products.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Discretionary Accessibility Reviews for Users with Disabilities:</strong> The Marketplace may, at its sole and unreviewable discretion, elect to conduct sporadic, non-systematic, and purely discretionary reviews of a limited subset of digital products and associated listings to subjectively assess, and internally evaluate, the perceived level of accessibility of such products and listings for users with disabilities, and to internally consider, on a purely discretionary and non-committal basis, the extent to which such products and listings may, or may not, align with aspirational accessibility guidelines, non-binding best practices, and hypothetical internal accessibility benchmarks, to the extent deemed subjectively applicable and operationally feasible by the Marketplace, in its sole and exclusive judgment. Seller explicitly acknowledges and agrees that any such discretionary accessibility reviews are undertaken solely for the Marketplace’s internal, non-public, and purely aspirational quality control and user experience enhancement purposes, and shall not be construed to create any legally binding obligations, warranties, representations, or guarantees to Seller or any third party regarding the actual accessibility, usability, or compliance with accessibility standards of Seller’s products or listings.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Non-Committal Intellectual Property and Authenticity Checks:</strong> The Marketplace may, at its sole and unreviewable discretion, choose to implement sporadic, non-comprehensive, and purely discretionary checks, utilizing automated tools, manual review processes, third-party databases, or other verification mechanisms, to internally assess, and subjectively evaluate, the potential for listed products to infringe upon intellectual property rights, or to detect potential listings of counterfeit, fraudulent, or otherwise unauthorized products, as hypothetically outlined in the Policy on Counterfeit or Infringing Products (Section 8 of this Seller Agreement), which, for the avoidance of all doubt, is explicitly understood and agreed by Seller to be a non-binding, aspirational, and purely discretionary internal guideline, and not a legally enforceable policy or contractual obligation. Seller explicitly acknowledges and agrees that any such discretionary intellectual property and authenticity checks are undertaken solely for the Marketplace’s internal risk management and quality control purposes, and shall not be construed to create any legally binding obligations, warranties, representations, or guarantees to Seller or any third party regarding the actual authenticity, legality, or non-infringement status of Seller’s products or listings.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Non-Binding and Discretionary Stages of the Product Listing Review Process:</strong> Seller explicitly acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the Marketplace’s Product Listing Review Process, if and when implemented, is inherently non-binding, purely discretionary, and subject to unilateral modification, suspension, or termination by the Marketplace at any time, without any obligation to provide prior notice or justification to Seller. Furthermore, Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Marketplace shall not be held liable for any failure to conduct product listing reviews, for the manner in which such reviews are conducted (if undertaken), or for any outcomes resulting from the Product Listing Review Process, including but not limited to any decisions regarding listing approval, rejection, or removal. The ultimate responsibility for the legality, quality, and non-infringement of listed products rests solely and exclusively with the Seller.<strong> </strong>The stages at which product listing reviews may, or may not, be selectively undertaken by the Marketplace, at its sole and unreviewable option, are purely illustrative, non-binding, and non-comprehensive, and may include, without limitation:</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Optional and Non-Guaranteed Pre-Publication Review (Pre-Moderation):</strong> The Marketplace may, at its sole and discretionary option, elect to, but is under no legal or contractual obligation to, conduct purely discretionary, non-systematic, and non-guaranteed reviews of a limited and non-representative sample of Seller product listings prior to the point at which such listings are made publicly accessible or commercially available on the Marketplace platform (so-called "pre-publication review" or "pre-moderation"). Seller explicitly acknowledges and agrees that any such pre-publication review, if and when undertaken by the Marketplace, is solely for the Marketplace’s internal quality control and risk management purposes, is not guaranteed to be implemented for all or even a representative sample of Seller listings, is inherently discretionary and non-binding, and shall not be construed to create any expectation, reliance, warranty, representation, or guarantee that any Seller listing will, in fact, be subjected to pre-publication review, or that any pre-publication review, if undertaken, will be comprehensive, accurate, or effective in identifying any or all potential deficiencies, non-compliances, or violations of Marketplace policies. Seller further explicitly acknowledges and agrees that pre-publication review may, or may not, be selectively implemented for certain categories of Sellers (e.g., new sellers, sellers with a history of policy violations), for certain categories of products deemed by the Marketplace to be inherently higher risk, or for listings that are automatically flagged by automated systems for potential review, all at the Marketplace’s sole and unreviewable discretion.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Discretionary and Non-Systematic Post-Publication Review (Post-Moderation):</strong> The Marketplace may, at its sole and unreviewable option, choose to conduct discretionary, non-systematic, and purely reactive reviews of product listings that are already actively published, commercially available, and publicly accessible on the Marketplace platform (so-called "post-publication review" or "post-moderation"). Seller explicitly acknowledges and agrees that any such post-publication review, if and when undertaken by the Marketplace, is solely for the Marketplace’s internal quality control, risk management, and reactive enforcement purposes, is not guaranteed to be implemented for all or even a representative sample of Seller listings, is inherently discretionary and non-binding, and shall not be construed to create any expectation, reliance, warranty, representation, or guarantee that any Seller listing will, in fact, be subjected to post-publication review, or that any post-publication review, if undertaken, will be comprehensive, accurate, or effective in identifying any or all potential deficiencies, non-compliances, or violations of Marketplace policies. Seller further explicitly acknowledges and agrees that post-publication reviews may, or may not, be selectively triggered by user reports, rights holders complaints, automated monitoring system alerts, random audits, internal quality control initiatives, or any other factors deemed relevant by the Marketplace, at its sole and unreviewable discretion.</p><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Illustrative and Non-Exhaustive Review Criteria Utilized by the Marketplace:</strong> Seller explicitly acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the criteria utilized by the Marketplace, if and when it elects to conduct any form of Product Listing Review Process, are inherently subjective, non-exhaustive, and subject to unilateral modification, expansion, contraction, or redefinition by the Marketplace at any time, without any obligation to provide prior notice or justification to Seller. Furthermore, Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Marketplace shall not be held liable for any failure to conduct product listing reviews, for the manner in which such reviews are conducted (if undertaken), or for any outcomes resulting from the Product Listing Review Process, including but not limited to any decisions regarding listing approval, rejection, or removal. The ultimate responsibility for the legality, quality, and non-infringement of listed products rests solely and exclusively with the Seller. The illustrative, non-binding, and non-comprehensive criteria that may, or may not, be selectively considered and subjectively evaluated by the Marketplace, at its sole and unreviewable option, during any discretionary Product Listing Review Process, may include, without limitation:</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Compliance with Overarching Content Policy Mandates:</strong> Subjective assessment of the extent to which product listings, and associated content, demonstrably adhere to the Marketplace’s overarching Content Policy mandates, ensuring that all published materials are perceived by the Marketplace, in its sole and subjective judgment, to be generally legal, broadly appropriate for a diverse user audience, and not overtly violative of explicitly proscribed prohibited content guidelines, as unilaterally interpreted and applied by the Marketplace.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Subjective Evaluation Against Non-Binding Quality Standards:</strong> Subjective and discretionary assessment of product listings against the Marketplace’s non-binding, aspirational, and purely illustrative Quality Standards for digital products, as hypothetically outlined in Section 3.1 of this Seller Agreement, to internally evaluate whether products are perceived by the Marketplace, in its sole and subjective judgment, to generally meet hypothetical minimum benchmarks for perceived functionality, demonstrable accuracy, overall completeness, and subjective user experience considerations, recognizing that such "Quality Standards" are explicitly understood and agreed by Seller to be non-binding, aspirational, and purely discretionary internal guidelines, and not legally enforceable contractual obligations.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Subjective Assessment of Accuracy and Truthfulness of Product Descriptions:</strong> Subjective and discretionary evaluation of the perceived accuracy, demonstrable completeness, and subjective truthfulness of product descriptions, pricing information, promotional claims, and other descriptive details and representations provided by the Seller in connection with product listings, to internally assess, and subjectively opine upon, the extent to which such materials are perceived by the Marketplace, in its sole and subjective judgment, to be generally accurate, reasonably complete, and not overtly misleading, deceptive, or materially false or unsubstantiated.</p><p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Discretionary Intellectual Property Compliance and Authenticity Review:</strong> Discretionary and non-committal review of product listings for potential,</p>',

We implement measures to avoid inadvertently collecting data that is not explicitly intended for public dissemination. We rely on the principle of "manifestly made public" data as the legal basis for this limited processing, recognizing that bloggers, by making this information publicly available, have a reduced expectation of privacy with respect to such data in the context of professional or promotional activities.</p>',

Specific Data Subject Rights Pertaining to Travel Blogger Directory Inclusion</strong></h3><p>If you are a travel blogger whose publicly available data has been collected and incorporated into our Travel Blogger Directory, you are afforded the following specific rights, which are supplementary to and do not supersede the general data subject rights articulated elsewhere in this Section 6:<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Enhanced Right to Access, Review, and Rectify Profile Data:</strong> Upon verifying your identity and establishing your association with the relevant social media profiles (typically through a secure social media account linking process solely for verification purposes), you are granted privileged access to review your pre-populated profile page within the Travel Blogger Directory. You possess the unfettered right to rectify any perceived inaccuracies, correct outdated information, or complete any incomplete data fields within your directory profile.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Unconditional Right to Object to Inclusion and Demand Profile Erasure:</strong> You retain the absolute and unconditional right to object to the inclusion of your publicly available data within the Travel Blogger Directory. Upon successful verification of your identity and confirmation of your status as the identified travel blogger, we will, without undue delay, permanently remove your profile from the Travel Blogger Directory and definitively cease any further processing of your publicly sourced data for directory-related purposes. To exercise this right, please direct your request, accompanied by sufficient identifying information for verification, to legal@trekguider.com.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Exclusive Right to Claim, Manage, and Control Profile Content:</strong> Once you affirmatively claim your pre-populated profile page within the Travel Blogger Directory (typically facilitated through secure social media account verification), you are vested with exclusive and comprehensive control over all content displayed on your profile. You may, at your sole discretion and without limitation, edit, modify, augment, enhance, refine, or entirely replace any and all elements of your profile information, ensuring complete user autonomy and granular control over your directory presence. Furthermore, you retain the ongoing option to unilaterally delete your profile entirely from the Travel Blogger Directory at any time, without requiring justification or external authorization.<br>We are resolutely committed to upholding data transparency and empowering travel bloggers with robust control over their publicly available data as presented within our directory. It is critically important to understand that while we will diligently remove your profile from the TrekGuider Travel Blogger Directory upon a valid request for erasure, this action does not, and cannot, effectuate the removal of your publicly available data from the original third-party social media platforms or websites from which it was initially sourced. The management and modification of your data on those external platforms remain exclusively within your control, governed by the terms of service and privacy policies of those respective third-party platforms.</p>',

      'paragraph-3' => '<h2><strong>3. Commission and Fee Structure</strong></h2><h3><strong>3.1. Seller Commission Tiers</strong></h3><p>The Marketplace employs a multi-tiered commission structure for sales made by sellers, designed to reward higher sales volumes with lower commission rates. The commission level achieved by a seller is permanent and will not be reduced based on future sales performance. An Exclusive Level (Level 4) with custom commission terms may be offered manually by the Marketplace administrator to select sellers.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 1:</strong> 10% commission on total sales from $0 to $100.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 2:</strong> 8% commission on total sales from $101 to $300.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 3:</strong> 5% commission on total sales from $300 and above.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 4: Exclusive Level:</strong> Custom commission terms set individually by the Marketplace administrator.<br><strong>New Seller Special:</strong> New sellers, upon registration, automatically start at a 5% commission rate (Level 3 commission) for the first 30 days following registration.

Please note that for international transactions, additional fees may apply as detailed below:<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Domestic Transactions (U.S.):</strong> 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for transactions using cards issued within the United States.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>International Cards:</strong> For transactions using cards issued outside of the United States, an additional fee of 1.5% is applied to the seller, on top of the domestic transaction fee.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> A 1% fee is charged for currency conversion when Stripe performs currency conversion for payouts to sellers in currencies other than USD. This fee is applicable to sellers.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Withdrawal Fees:</strong> Sellers incur a fee of 0.25% + $0.25 per withdrawal transaction when withdrawing their earnings from the Marketplace.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Active Seller Fee:</strong> The Marketplace is charged $2 per month by Stripe for each active seller. An active seller is defined as a seller who has processed at least one withdrawal during the month.<br>For clarity, "international transactions" may incur additional costs including the 1.5% fee for international cards and the 1% currency conversion fee (if applicable). These fees are charged by Stripe and are passed on to the seller.</p><h3><strong>3.3. Additional Charges</strong></h3><p>In addition to the fees outlined above, users may incur additional charges imposed by their own banks or intermediary financial services used for transactions. These charges are not controlled by the Marketplace and are the sole responsibility of the user. Examples of such additional charges may include:<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Currency conversion fees</strong> applied by the user\'s bank if the payment is made in a currency other than USD.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>International transaction fees</strong> or cross-border fees charged by the user\'s bank for transactions originating from or destined to international accounts.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Fees for specific payment methods</strong> that are not directly processed by Stripe but are facilitated through intermediary payment services chosen by the user.<br>Users are advised to consult with their banks or payment service providers to understand any potential additional fees before making transactions on the Marketplace. TrekGuider Inc. is not responsible for these external fees and shall not be liable for any financial losses incurred by users as a result of such fees.</p><h3><strong>3.4. Donation Fees</strong></h3><p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Platform Donation Fee:</strong> For each donation made to a seller through the "Donate" button, the Marketplace will apply a platform service fee of 5% of the total donation amount. This fee supports the operation and maintenance of the donation feature and the Marketplace platform.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Stripe Processing Fees for Donations:</strong> Standard Stripe processing fees, as detailed in Section 3.2, will also apply to donation transactions. These fees are in addition to the Marketplace\'s 5% platform donation fee and are consistent with fees applied to other transactions on the Marketplace.<br>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Fee Deduction:</strong> Both the Marketplace platform donation fee and Stripe processing fees will be automatically deducted from the donation amount at the time of transaction, with the net donation amount credited to the Seller\'s Marketplace account balance.</p>',

Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program</strong></h3><p>TrekGuider Inc. is firmly committed to preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financial activities. Users acknowledge that the AML Compliance Program is a discretionary initiative undertaken by the Marketplace to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain platform integrity. Users remain solely and fully responsible for ensuring the legality and legitimacy of their own transactions and activities on the Marketplace<strong>. </strong>To uphold the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct, the Marketplace operates a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Program, designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations of the United States and international standards. These include, but are not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This section outlines the key components of the Marketplace’s AML Compliance Program and the measures implemented to detect, prevent, and report potential money laundering activities.</p><ul><li><strong>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Procedures:</strong> Maintaining a robust Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) program is fundamental to the Marketplace’s AML compliance efforts. These procedures are rigorously applied to verify the identity of all users, with enhanced scrutiny for sellers and, where applicable, buyers who maintain significant balances or engage in high-value transactions on the platform. The KYC program is essential for mitigating the risk of illicit activities and preserving the integrity of the Marketplace.</li><li><strong>Risk-Based Verification Procedures:</strong> The Marketplace employs a risk-based approach to KYC, tailoring verification procedures to the assessed risk profile of each user. Verification procedures include, but are not limited to:</li><li><strong>Collection of Identifying Information:</strong> Gathering comprehensive identifying information from users during registration and account setup, including full legal names, residential and business addresses, dates of birth, contact information (email and phone number), and citizenship. For legal entities, this includes verification of business registration details, beneficial ownership information, and control structures.</li><li><strong>Documentary Verification:</strong> Requiring users to provide government-issued identification documents (e.g., passports, driver\'s licenses, national ID cards) and, for U.S. persons, Social Security Numbers (SSN) or Employer Identification Numbers (EIN). The Marketplace employs Stripe’s advanced verification services as a key tool within its comprehensive KYC program to electronically authenticate user identities against trusted data sources and government databases, ensuring compliance with payment processing regulations and AML standards. However, the Marketplace retains ultimate responsibility for its AML compliance program and the effectiveness of its KYC procedures.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):</strong> Conducting Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for users identified as higher risk, based on factors such as geographic location, transaction patterns, or business type. EDD measures may include requesting additional documentation, conducting independent verification of information, and enhanced monitoring of account activity.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring and Updates:</strong> The Marketplace’s KYC program includes ongoing monitoring of user accounts and activities to identify and assess evolving risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. User information is periodically reviewed and updated to ensure accuracy and completeness. Triggers for enhanced scrutiny and KYC updates may include changes in user profile information, significant changes in transaction patterns, or alerts from monitoring systems.</li><li><strong>Reliance on Stripe Verification:</strong> While leveraging Stripe’s verification services as a primary KYC tool, the Marketplace retains ultimate responsibility for AML compliance and reserves the right to implement additional KYC measures beyond Stripe verification as deemed necessary to fully comply with AML regulations, address specific risk factors, and adapt to evolving regulatory expectations.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Transaction Monitoring System:</strong> The Marketplace maintains a sophisticated, multi-layered Transaction Monitoring System to rigorously scrutinize and analyze all transactions for suspicious patterns, anomalies, and activities indicative of potential money laundering or terrorist financing. This system integrates both advanced automated tools and expert manual review processes to ensure effective detection and investigation of illicit financial flows.</li><li><strong>Advanced Automated Monitoring Tools:</strong> The Transaction Monitoring System utilizes cutting-edge automated tools, including Stripe Radar and other industry-leading fraud prevention and AML compliance solutions, to continuously screen transactions against a comprehensive suite of pre-defined risk indicators, rules-based typologies, and dynamic behavioral thresholds. These automated tools are configured to detect a wide range of suspicious activities, including, but not limited to:</li><li><strong>Anomalous Transaction Amounts:</strong> Transactions involving unusually large sums of money that are inconsistent with the user’s known profile or typical transaction history.</li><li><strong>High-Risk Geographic Indicators:</strong> Transactions originating from, destined to, or involving users associated with jurisdictions identified as high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing by international bodies such as FATF or subject to sanctions by OFAC or other relevant authorities.</li><li><strong>Unusual Transaction Patterns:</strong> Rapid, erratic, or inexplicable patterns of transactions, including sudden spikes in transaction velocity or volume, unusual timing of transactions, or circular transaction flows.</li><li><strong>Suspicious Account Activity:</strong> Accounts exhibiting unusual or high-risk activity patterns, such as accounts with multiple users, accounts used for rapid layering of funds, or accounts linked to known suspicious entities or activities.</li><li><strong>Linkage to Fraudulent or Illicit Activity Indicators:</strong> Transactions that exhibit characteristics associated with known fraud schemes, money laundering typologies, or terrorist financing methods, including patterns identified by Stripe Radar, machine learning algorithms, and intelligence sources.</li><li><strong>Proprietary and Undisclosed Security Metrics and Algorithms:</strong> The Transaction Monitoring System incorporates proprietary, constantly evolving security metrics, behavioral analytics algorithms, and machine learning models, the specific details of which are not publicly disclosed to maintain the security and effectiveness of the system and prevent potential circumvention. These advanced analytics are designed to proactively detect evolving money laundering typologies, emerging financial crime trends, and sophisticated evasion techniques.</li><li><strong>Expert Manual Review and Analysis:</strong> Transactions that are flagged as potentially suspicious by the automated system, or identified through other intelligence sources or internal controls, are immediately escalated for in-depth manual review and analysis by highly trained compliance personnel. Manual review involves a comprehensive investigation of transaction details, user profiles, contextual information, and supporting documentation to determine whether a transaction genuinely warrants reporting to regulatory authorities as suspicious activity. Compliance personnel utilize their expertise and judgment to assess the totality of circumstances and make informed decisions regarding SAR filing.</li><li><strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Procedures:</strong> The Marketplace has implemented clearly defined, legally compliant procedures for Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) to ensure timely and accurate reporting of potentially illicit financial activities to the appropriate financial intelligence unit, which in the United States is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).</li><li><strong>Prompt SAR Filing:</strong> If, through the Transaction Monitoring System, manual review, or any other detection mechanism, the Marketplace identifies activity that triggers suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit financial activities, a comprehensive Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) will be meticulously prepared and filed with FinCEN in strict accordance with all regulatory requirements, legal deadlines, and established protocols.</li><li><strong>Confidentiality and Legal Protections for SAR Filings:</strong> All SAR filings, supporting documentation, and related internal investigations are handled with the utmost confidentiality, adhering to the stringent confidentiality requirements mandated by law and regulatory guidance. The Marketplace maintains a strict policy of non-disclosure regarding SAR filings and will not, under any circumstances, notify users whose activities are being reported in a SAR. This confidentiality is essential to protect the integrity of law enforcement investigations and is legally mandated to prevent potential tipping off of subjects of SARs. The Marketplace avails itself of all legal safe harbors and protections afforded to financial institutions and other reporting entities under the BSA and related regulations for SAR filings made in good faith.</li><li><strong>Standardized SAR Reporting Procedures:</strong> SAR reporting procedures are meticulously documented, regularly reviewed, and consistently updated to adhere to industry best practices, evolving regulatory expectations, and FinCEN guidelines. These standardized procedures ensure the consistent, accurate, and legally compliant reporting of suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities, facilitating effective law enforcement action against financial crime.</li><li><strong>A designated Compliance Officer</strong> within TrekGuider Inc.<strong> </strong>is responsible for the<strong> </strong>oversight, strategic direction, and effective implementation<strong> </strong>of the Marketplace’s<strong> </strong>AML Compliance Program. The Compliance Officer’s responsibilities encompass:</li><li><strong>Program Development and Implementation:</strong> Leading the design, development, and ongoing enhancement of the Marketplace’s AML Compliance Program, ensuring its alignment with evolving regulatory requirements, industry best practices, and the Marketplace’s specific risk profile.</li><li><strong>Policy and Procedure Management:</strong> Establishing, documenting, and maintaining comprehensive AML policies, procedures, and internal controls, covering all aspects of AML compliance, including KYC/CDD, transaction monitoring, SAR reporting, record keeping, and sanctions screening.</li><li><strong>Training and Awareness:</strong> Developing and delivering comprehensive AML training programs for all relevant personnel, ensuring that all employees, agents, and contractors are thoroughly trained on their AML compliance obligations, responsibilities, and the Marketplace’s internal policies and procedures.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring and Oversight:</strong> Continuously monitoring the effectiveness of the AML Compliance Program, conducting periodic risk assessments, overseeing transaction monitoring activities, and ensuring timely and accurate SAR reporting.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Liaison and Audit Management:</strong> Serving as the primary point of contact for regulatory inquiries, audits, and examinations related to AML compliance. Managing regulatory examinations, responding to inquiries from supervisory authorities, and ensuring timely remediation of any identified compliance gaps or deficiencies.</li><li><strong>Program Updates and Adaptation:</strong> Remaining continuously informed of evolving AML regulations, emerging financial crime trends, and industry best practices. Proactively updating and adapting the AML Compliance Program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness, responsiveness to new risks, and continued alignment with regulatory expectations.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Record Keeping Requirements:</strong> The Marketplace maintains meticulous and legally compliant records of all transactions processed through the platform, as well as all documentation and data related to customer due diligence, KYC verification, transaction monitoring, SAR filings, and AML program administration. These records are securely stored, readily accessible for audits and regulatory inquiries, and retained for a minimum period of <strong>five years</strong> from the date of transaction or account closure, or for such longer period as may be explicitly mandated by applicable laws, regulations, and statutes of limitations. Record keeping practices are meticulously designed to comply with all legal requirements, industry standards, and evidentiary best practices, ensuring the comprehensive availability of transaction data, KYC information, and AML program documentation for regulatory audits, law enforcement investigations, and internal compliance reviews.</li><li><strong>Sanctions Screening: Robust and Integrated Sanctions Screening Protocols:</strong> The Marketplace has seamlessly integrated exceptionally robust, technologically advanced, and continuously updated Sanctions Screening Protocols into its comprehensive AML Compliance Program. These protocols are meticulously designed and rigorously implemented to proactively prevent transactions with comprehensively sanctioned individuals, entities, and countries and to ensure unwavering adherence to all applicable sanctions laws, regulations, and evolving enforcement priorities.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive and Regularly Updated Sanctions List Screening:</strong> The Marketplace employs state-of-the-art, automated sanctions screening systems to conduct continuous, real-time, and retrospective screening of users (with a particular focus on sellers, high-value buyers, and users engaged in cross-border transactions) and all transactions against an exhaustive, dynamically updated, and meticulously curated compendium of relevant sanctions lists, restricted parties lists, and government watchlists. These lists include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), the BIS Denied Persons List, the BIS Entity List, the BIS Unverified List, the United Nations Security Council Consolidated List, the European Union Consolidated Financial Sanctions List, and other applicable lists promulgated by U.S., international, and national authorities worldwide. The sanctions list database is automatically updated multiple times daily to incorporate the most recent revisions, additions, and removals issued by relevant sanctions authorities, ensuring that the Marketplace’s screening processes reflect the most current and comprehensive sanctions landscape.</li><li><strong>Advanced Automated Screening Tools and Technologies:</strong> Sanctions screening is executed utilizing highly sophisticated, industry-leading automated screening tools, software platforms, and data analytics technologies that are continuously enhanced and refined to incorporate the latest advancements in sanctions detection, watchlist management, and risk-based compliance methodologies. These advanced tools employ fuzzy logic matching algorithms, phonetic matching techniques, and name variation analysis to minimize false positives while maximizing the accurate identification of potential sanctions matches, even in cases of incomplete, inconsistent, or intentionally obfuscated user data. The automated screening systems are configured to meticulously scrutinize user registration information, account profiles, transaction details, payment instructions, geographic indicators, and other relevant data points against sanctions lists in real-time, near real-time, and through periodic batch screening processes.</li><li><strong>Expert Manual Review, Adjudication, and Risk-Based Escalation:</strong> Screening results that generate potential matches ("hits") are not treated as definitive violations but are immediately flagged for expert manual review, in-depth adjudication, and risk-based escalation by highly trained compliance personnel specializing in sanctions compliance and financial crime investigations. Manual review processes are meticulously documented, consistently applied, and subject to rigorous quality control and oversight. Compliance personnel conduct thorough investigations to: (i) meticulously verify the accuracy and relevance of potential matches, minimizing false positives and ensuring that only true matches are escalated; (ii) comprehensively assess the risk profile associated with each potential match, considering factors such as the nature of the user’s activities, geographic risk indicators, transaction patterns, and available contextual information; (iii) determine whether a true, confirmed match exists between the user or transaction and a sanctioned party or jurisdiction; and (iv) escalate confirmed matches and high-risk cases to senior compliance management and legal counsel for final determination and appropriate action.</li><li><strong>Ongoing, Dynamic, and Risk-Adaptive Monitoring:</strong> Sanctions screening is not confined to initial user onboarding or point-in-time transaction checks but is implemented as a continuous, dynamic, and risk-adaptive monitoring process that operates throughout the entire customer relationship lifecycle. The Marketplace’s sanctions screening protocols are continuously adjusted and refined to proactively adapt to evolving sanctions landscapes, emerging evasion typologies, changes in regulatory guidance, and the Marketplace’s own evolving risk profile. Ongoing monitoring includes periodic re-screening of user databases against updated sanctions lists, continuous surveillance of user account activity for red flags indicative of sanctions violations, and proactive risk assessments to identify and mitigate emerging sanctions compliance vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Purpose of Sanctions Screening Procedures and Legal Compliance Imperative:</strong> The overarching purpose of the Marketplace’s Sanctions Screening Procedures is to ensure unwavering, comprehensive, and demonstrable compliance with all applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by OFAC and BIS, as well as relevant international sanctions regimes and best practices for sanctions compliance. These rigorous screening procedures are not merely a perfunctory or checkbox exercise but are a mission-critical, legally mandated, and ethically driven imperative for the Marketplace to: (i) prevent the platform from being utilized, directly or indirectly, to facilitate transactions with sanctioned parties or in sanctioned jurisdictions; (ii) mitigate the significant legal, financial, regulatory, and reputational risks associated with sanctions violations; (iii) uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct, corporate responsibility, and global citizenship; and (iv) maintain the long-term sustainability, integrity, and trustworthiness of the TrekGuider Marketplace as a legally compliant, ethically operated, and socially responsible global platform for digital commerce.</li><li>The Marketplace unequivocally reserves the right to unilaterally update, amend, and comprehensively modify this AML Compliance Program, including all constituent policies, procedures, and internal controls, at any time, with or without prior notice, as deemed necessary to ensure continuous, unimpeachable compliance with evolving legal and regulatory requirements, to proactively mitigate emerging financial crime risks, and to enhance the overall effectiveness, robustness, and adaptability of its AML program.</li></ul><h3><strong>4.6.
